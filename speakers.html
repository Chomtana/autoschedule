<p>I am always fascinated about programming languages. In particular, I have long advocated for the use of functional
programming over object-oriented programming and a declarative style over an imperative one. Despite having used
Python heavily since 2013, groking Scala, Haskell and Clojure really changed my style of writing Python code.
I would like to share some of my findings and advocate a functional style of programming in Python. My other
interests include Bayesian statistics, Monte Carlo methods and high-performance computing.</p>
<p>I am a co-founder and managing director of Arithmox, a startup offering CTO-as-a-service and growth hacking
packages to Indonesian companies. My interest lies in the use of technology and data-driven approaches correctly
to drive growth. In a business climate where it is easy to get sucked into the AI hype, I advocate a pragmatic
and no-nonsense approach to introducing such technologies into already-running businesses.</p>

<p>I am currently researching in the field of NLP and information retrieval as a project assistant at IIT Delhi. I am a recent graduate, and had been conferred with a degree of Bachelors in technology in Computer Science, in August 2018.
I got introduced to the wonders of computer science while pursuing my undergraduate degree, and oh, boy! It was diverse. I was amazed with the profusion of avenues that it opened for me. From natural language chatbots, to  biometrics recognition systems, path-planning robots, I found it ever-so encouraging just to be in the game, and with a curious eye, was ready to unearth it all.
I can program in multiple languages, Python, C/C++, R, Matlab, Chapel, GoLang, Java , Python being my first love since freshman days!.  Recently I have started programming in GoLang, and it happens to be new found love. I am interested in the fields of NLP, ML, AI, having studied them during my senior year, and I wish to work on  enhancing healthcare with AI. More specifically  I want to work towards making technology come to the the aid of unfortunately or differently abled people, so that they can lead healthy lives. I am inspired by the advancing developments in making computers imitate and understand human language, vision and intelligence and so much more, which I feel can be used to solve challenges that the differently abled people face.
I am an avid reader, an eloquent writer, and love to share my experiences with others as well as learn from others. I do love to talk a lot too. A cup of hot chocolate, my laptop and a problem to code on, is what my daily routine sounds like.</p>

<p>I am a pre final student at The LNM Institute of Information Technology pursuing B-Tech in Computer Science
Engineering. I have a Deep interest in open source technologies, and was selected as Mozilla Open Leader this year.
I like to code in Python and developing Natural Language Processing applications in python. I have studied
Information Retrieval as an academic course and my my interest in this field grew from there. In this talk I will
elaborate on my project where I used TWEEPY library of python to extract and evaluate tweets. I believe Information
Retrieval is a interesting topic and will attract audience from all the field and all experience levels.</p>
